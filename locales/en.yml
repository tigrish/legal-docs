            markdown: ! "Your privacy is critically important to us. At %{company_short_name}
              we have a few fundamental principles:\n\n1. We don't ask you for personal
              information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask
              you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)\n2.
              We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply
              with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.\n3. We don't
              store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going
              operation of one of our services.\n4. We aim to make it as simple as
              possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search
              engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.\n\nBelow is our privacy
              policy which incorporates these goals:\n\nIf you have questions about
              deleting or correcting your personal data please email us <%{service_support_email}>\n\nIt
              is %{company_short_name}’s policy to respect your privacy regarding
              any information we may collect while operating our websites.\n\n## Website
              Visitors\nLike most website operators, %{company_short_name} collects
              non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
              and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
              preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.\n\n%{company_short_name}'s
              purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
              understand how %{company_short_name}'s visitors use its website.\n\nFrom
              time to time, %{company_short_name} may release non-personally-identifying
              information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends
              in the usage of its website.\n\n%{company_short_name} also collects
              potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
              (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments or
              contributing to projects.\n\n%{company_short_name} only discloses logged
              in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that
              it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described
              below, except that contributor IP addresses are visible and disclosed
              to the relevant project owner.\n\n## Gathering of Personally-Identifying
              Information\n\nCertain visitors to %{company_short_name}’s websites
              choose to interact with %{company_short_name} in ways that require %{company_short_name}
              to gather personally-identifying information.\n\nThe amount and type
              of information that %{company_short_name} gathers depends on the nature
              of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an
              account at [%{service_name}](%{service_url}) to provide a username and
              email address.\n\nThose who engage in transactions with %{company_short_name}
              – by purchasing access to paid services, for example – are asked to
              provide additional information, including as necessary the personal
              and financial information required to process those transactions.\n\nIn
              each case, %{company_short_name} collects such information only insofar
              as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor’s
              interaction with %{company_short_name}.\n\n%{company_short_name} does
              not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
              below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
              information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging
              in certain website-related activities.\n\n## Aggregated Statistics\n\n%{company_short_name}
              may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to its websites.
              For instance, %{company_short_name} may monitor the most popular projects
              on the [%{service_name}](%{service_url}).\n\n%{company_short_name} may
              display this information publicly or provide it to others. However,
              %{company_short_name} does not disclose personally-identifying information
              other than as described below.\n\n## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying
              Information\n\n%{company_short_name} discloses potentially personally-identifying
              and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
              contractors and affiliated organisations that;\n\n* need to know that
              information in order to process it on %{company_short_name}’s behalf
              or to provide services available at %{company_short_name}’s websites,
              and\n* that have agreed not to disclose it to others. \n\nSome of those
              employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be located outside
              of your home country; by using %{company_short_name}’s websites, you
              consent to the transfer of such information to them.\n\n%{company_short_name}
              will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
              information to anyone.\n\nOther than to its employees, contractors and
              affiliated organisations, as described above, %{company_short_name}
              discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
              information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental
              request, or when %{company_short_name} believes in good faith that disclosure
              is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of %{company_short_name},
              third parties or the public at large.\n\nIf you are a registered user
              of an %{service_name} account and have supplied your email address,
              %{company_short_name} may occasionally send you an email to tell you
              about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
              with what’s going on with %{company_short_name} and our products.\n\nWe
              primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of
              information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.\n\nIf
              you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of
              our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order
              to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support
              other users.\n\n%{company_short_name} takes all measures reasonably
              necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration
              or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
              information.\n\n## Cookies\n\nA cookie is a string of information that
              a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser
              provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\n\n%{company_short_name}
              uses cookies to help %{company_short_name} identify and track visitors,
              their usage of %{company_short_name} website, and their website access
              preferences.\n\n%{company_short_name} visitors who do not wish to have
              cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse
              cookies before using %{company_short_name}’s websites, with the drawback
              that certain features of %{company_short_name}’s websites may not function
              properly without the aid of cookies.\n\n## Business Transfers\n\nIf
              %{company_short_name}, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired,
              or in the unlikely event that %{company_short_name} goes out of business
              or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that
              is transferred or acquired by a third party.\n\nYou acknowledge that
              such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of %{company_short_name}
              may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.\n\n##
              Ads\n\nAds appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users
              by advertising partners, who may set cookies.\n\nThese cookies allow
              the ad server to recognise your computer each time they send you an
              online advertisement to compile information about you or others who
              use your computer.\n\nThis information allows ad networks to, among
              other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will
              be of most interest to you.\n\nThis Privacy Policy covers the use of
              cookies by %{company_short_name} and does not cover the use of cookies
              by any advertisers.\n\n## Privacy Policy Changes\n\nAlthough most changes
              are likely to be minor, %{company_short_name} may change its Privacy
              Policy from time to time, and in %{company_short_name}’s sole discretion.\n\n%{company_short_name}
              encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
              its Privacy Policy. If you have a %{service_name} account, you should
              also check your project's dashboard for alerts to these changes.\n\nYour
              continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will
              constitute your acceptance of such change.\n\n*Thanks to [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com)

              its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property
